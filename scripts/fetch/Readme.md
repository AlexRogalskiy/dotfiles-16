# fetch

## Big updates: Check the releases page.

This is the home of my fetch script! This script gathers info <br\>
about your system and prints it to the terminal.

The script currently supports Linux, Mac OS X and Windows (Cygwin), if your OS or distro isn't
supported open an issue and I'll add support for it.

<!-- Dependences {{{ -->


## Dependencies


These are the script's required dependencies

-  Text formatting, dynamic image size and padding: tput
-  Uptime detection: procps or procps-ng

These are the script's optional dependencies:

-  Displaying Images: w3m
    - You may also need w3m-img
-  Image Cropping: ImageMagick
-  Display Wallpaper: feh
-  Current Song: mpc
-  Resolution Detection: xorg-xdpyinfo
-  Window manager detection: wmctrl
    - This is used as a fallback to parsing ```.xinitrc``` and ```$XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP```.
-  Take a screenshot on script finish: scrot
    - I'll add an option to specify a custom cmd soon.

<!-- Usage {{{ -->


## Usage

The script now supports dynamic image sizing and padding,
<br\> it's enabled by default and there's a variable you
<br\> need to set for it to work correctly.

You can either change the variable $fontwidth inside of the
<br\> script or launch it with ```--font_width num```.

Once you set the var the script will scale the image and padding
<br\> to fit your terminal window.

Please report any bugs or issues you're having with this as I can't
<br\> test with many configurations.

## TODO

Here's what's on my todo list

- Cleanup of info array handling

- Windows support (I'm almost done)

- Imagemagick optimizations

- More info outputs. Now that it's easy to customize what's printed and
  everything is a function we can add optional support for pretty much anything.

    - Resolution (Done!)
    - GTK themes
    - Terminal Font
    - GPU
    - IP
    - etc
