This is the home of my fetch script! This script gathers info <br />
about your system and prints it to the terminal next to an image of your choice!

<!-- Features {{{ -->


## Features


- **Supports Linux, Mac OS X, \*BSD and Windows (Cygwin)!**
    - If the script isn't working on your system open an issue.
        - *BSD support is currently in testing! See issue [#10](https://github.com/dylanaraps/fetch/issues/10#issuecomment-172432389)
- **It's Fast**
    - The script makes heavy use of bash builtins and <br \>string manipulation.
- **Display an image next to the info. (or don't!)**
    - The script can use your current wallpaper, shuffle through a directory or just <br \>display an image of your choice.
        - The wallpaper function on linux uses feh, It's hard to add support <br \>
          for other wallpaper setters as they don't provide a way of getting <br \>
          the current wallpaper from the cli.
- **Highly Customizable**
    - You can customize almost everything.
        - See Usage below or lines 23-233 in script
- **Take a screenshot at the end.**
    - It's disabled by default and you can specify the cmd <br \>to use with `--scrotcmd cmd` at launch or by <br \>changing the value of `$scrotcmd` in the script.
- **Smart crop (or Waifu crop)**
    - See https://github.com/dylanaraps/fetch/wiki/What-is-Smart-Crop%3F

<!-- Dependences {{{ -->


## Dependencies


#### Required dependencies:

-  Bash **4.0+**
-  Text formatting, dynamic image size and padding: `tput`
-  Uptime detection: `procps` or `procps-ng`

#### Optional dependencies:

All OS:

-  Displaying Images: `w3m`
    - You may also need `w3m-img`
    - **Note:** The script can now also use iTerm2's builtin image rendering instead of w3m!
        - Enable it by changing `image_backend` to `iterm2` or by using the launch flag `--image_backend`.
-  Image Cropping, Resizing etc: `ImageMagick`
-  Current Song: `mpc`
-  Resolution Detection: `xorg-xdpyinfo`
-  Window manager detection: `wmctrl`
    - This is used as a fallback to parsing `.xinitrc` and `$XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP`.
-  Take a screenshot on script finish: `scrot`
    - You can change this to another program with a `--scrotcmd` and an in script option.

Linux | \*BSD:

-  Display Wallpaper: `feh`

### Arch

1. Install `fetch-git` from the aur.


### Others

1. Download the latest source at https://github.com/dylanaraps/fetch
2. Make the file executable using chmod. `chmod +x /path/to/fetch`
3. Move the script to somewhere in your $PATH or just run it from where it is.

## Post Install


**NOTE:** For the images to be sized correctly you need to set the `$font_width` variable.
If you don't know your font width in pixels keep trying values until the image is sized correctly.

You can also use the launch flag `--font_width` to set it on the fly.

You can customize what info to print by editing the info array near the top of the script.
The array looks like this:

```sh
info=(
    "gettitle"
    "underline"
    "OS: getdistro"
    "Kernel: getkernel"
    "Uptime: getuptime"
    "Packages: getpackages"
    etc...
)
```

See these comments inside the script for more info:
https://github.com/dylanaraps/fetch/blob/master/fetch#L29

If you don't want to edit the script you can customize everything using flags at launch!

Here's what my fetch alias looks like:

```sh
alias fetch2="fetch \
--block_range 1 8 \
--line_wrap off \
--bold off \
--uptime_shorthand on \
--gtk_shorthand on \
--exclude 'Icons: getgtkicons' \
--exclude 'Resolution: getresolution' \
--colors 4 1 8 8 8 7 \
"
```

<!-- Issues and Workarounds {{{ -->


## Issues and Workarounds


#### The image is rendering with black lines in Urxvt while using an xft font.

This is an issue with w3mimgdisplay and not the script. You can find a workaround here:

https://github.com/hut/ranger/issues/86#issuecomment-17346249


#### The text is too long for my terminal window and wraps to the next line causing the image to not render correctly.

There are a few ways to fix this.

* Disable line wrapping with `$line_wrap off` in the script or with the launch flag `--line_wrap off`

* The uptime and gtk info lines each have a shorthand option that makes their output smaller. You can <br \>
  enable them by changing these variables or using these flags.

```sh
# In script options
$uptime_shorthand on
$gtk_shorthand on

# Launch flags
--uptime_shorthand on
--gtk_shorthand on
```

* Edit the info array to make the subtitles shorter

* Resizing the terminal so that the lines don't wrap.


#### [Linux] The script hangs and doesn't display anything

This is caused by the getwallpaper function failing to find your current wallpaper and <br \>
imagemagick trying to crop a nonexistent image. You can fix this by installing feh and using it<br \>
to set your wallpaper or by changing the image source.

You can change the source by editing the `$image` variable or by launching the script with `--image`.

The possible values are:

* **wall** - Use the current wallpaper. (Default)
* **shuffle** - Shuffle through images in a directory. See `$shuffledir`
* **path/to/img.png** - Select an image to display.
* **off** - Disable images


#### getgpu doesn't show my exact video card name

If you're output looks like this:

```
01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: NVIDIA Corporation Device 1401 (rev a1)
```

Instead of this:

```
01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: NVIDIA Corporation GM206 [GeForce GTX 960] (rev a1)
```

Then you're affected by the issue.

This is caused by your `/usr/share/misc/pci.ids\*` files being outdated and you can fix it<br \>
by running this command as root.

```
sudo update-pciids
```

<!-- TODO {{{ -->


## TODO

Here's what's on my todo list

- Add Windows resolution detection

- Cleanup of info array handling

- Imagemagick optimizations

- More info outputs. Now that it's easy to customize what's printed and<br \>
  everything is a function we can add optional support for pretty much anything.

    - Resolution (Done! Just missing Windows support)
    - GTK themes (Done!)
    - Terminal Font
    - GPU (In master but experimental) See **[issue #21](https://github.com/dylanaraps/fetch/issues/21)**.
    - IP
    - etc
