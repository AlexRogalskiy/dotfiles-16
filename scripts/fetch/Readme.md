# fetch.sh

This is the home of my fetch script! This script gathers info <br\>
about your system and prints it to the terminal.

I've spent the past few days rewriting this and it now supports <br\>
other distros as well as a ton of new features and bug fixes.

If you're having any issues or have any ideas, please open an issue! <br\>
I can't test on many other distros and I want this to work <br\>
for as many people as possible.

## TODO

Here's what's on my todo list

- Add an easy way to define info prefixes at launch.
- Find a reliable way to set the text padding dynamically. I can get this to
  <br/> work based on font width but there's no reliable way of getting
  <br/> fontwidth for every terminal afaik.
- Find a quick and reliable way to get the current window manager. I had a
  <br/> solution that used an array of processes and pgrep but it doubled the
  <br/> startup time for the script.

If you've got any ideas on how to solve these problems, let me know!


## Customization

I launch fetch using a shell function and a ton of flags. Here's how it looks:

```sh
fetch () {
    fetch.sh \
        --printcols 1 7 \
        --cpu "AMD FX-6300" \
        --song "$(mpc current | cut -c 1-30)" \
        --uptime "$(uptime -p | sed -e 's/minutes/mins/')" \
        --title "dylan's pc" \
        $@
}
```

Notice how you can even pass commands? This allows you to easily use custom
<br/> commands or even just bare strings to change the info.
