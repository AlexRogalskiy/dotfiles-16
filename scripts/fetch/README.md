# fetch

This is the home of my fetch script! This script gathers info <br />
about your system and prints it to the terminal next to an image of your choice!

**NOTE: See this wiki page for info on the new info function and it's usage**

<!-- Features {{{ -->


## Features

- **Supports Linux, Mac OS X, BSD and Windows (Cygwin)!**
    - If the script doesn't work on your system, open an issue.
- **It's Fast**
    - The script makes heavy use of bash builtins and <br \>string manipulation.
- **Display an image next to the info. (or don't!)**
    - Use your current wallpaper, shuffle through a directory or just <br \>display an image of your choice.
    - Supports using w3m or iTerm2 to display the images.
- **Highly Customizable**
    - You can customize almost everything.
        - See Usage below or lines 23-233 in script
- **Take a screenshot at the end.**
    - It's disabled by default and you can specify the cmd <br \>to use with `--scrotcmd cmd` at launch or by <br \>changing the value of `$scrotcmd` in the script.
- **Smart crop (or Waifu crop)**
    - See https://github.com/dylanaraps/fetch/wiki/What-is-Smart-Crop%3F

<!-- Dependences {{{ -->


## Dependencies


### Required dependencies:

**All OS:**

-  `Bash 4.0+`
-  Text formatting, dynamic image size and padding: `tput`

**Linux / BSD / Windows:**

-  Uptime detection: `procps` or `procps-ng`

### Optional dependencies:

**All OS:**

-  Displaying Images: `w3m`
    - You may also need `w3m-img`
    - **Note:** The script can now also use iTerm2's builtin image rendering instead of w3m!
        - Enable it by changing `image_backend` to `iterm2` or by using the launch flag `--image_backend`.
-  Image Cropping, Resizing etc: `ImageMagick`
-  Window manager detection: `wmctrl`
    - This is used as a fallback to parsing `.xinitrc` and `$XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP`.

**Linux / BSD:**

-  Display Wallpaper: `feh` or `nitrogen`
-  Current Song: `mpc` or `cmus`
-  Resolution Detection: `xorg-xdpyinfo`
-  Take a screenshot on script finish: `scrot`
    - You can change this to another program with a `--scrotcmd` and an in script option.

## Post Install


#### Sizing the image correctly

**NOTE:** For the images to be sized correctly you need to set the `$font_width` variable.
If you don't know your font width in pixels keep trying values until the image is sized correctly.

You can also use the launch flag `--font_width` to set it on the fly.


#### Customizing what info gets displayed

At the top of the script there's a function that allows you to customize all of the info that gets displayed.

Here's what you can do:

- Add new info lines
- Change the ordering of the info
- Remove unwanted info lines
- Use bash syntax to control when info gets displayed

See this wiki page that goes more in-depth about it:

https://github.com/dylanaraps/fetch/wiki/Customizing-Info


#### Customizing the script using a custom alias

If you don't want to edit the script you can customize almost everything using launch flags!

Here's what my fetch alias looks like:

```sh
alias fetch2="fetch \
--block_range 1 8 \
--line_wrap off \
--bold off \
--uptime_shorthand on \
--gtk_shorthand on \
--colors 4 1 8 8 8 7 \
"
```

<!-- Frequently Asked Questions {{{ -->


## Frequently Asked Questions


#### Why doesn't fetch support my wallpaper setter?

It's hard to add support for other wallpaper setters as<br \>
they don't provide a way of getting the current wallpaper from the cli.

If your wallpaper setter **does** provide a way of getting the current wallpaper<br \>
or you know where it's stored then adding support won't be a problem!<br \>

<!-- Issues and Workarounds {{{ -->


## Issues and Workarounds


#### The image is rendering with black lines in Urxvt while using an xft font.

This is an issue with w3mimgdisplay and not the script. You can find a workaround here:

https://github.com/hut/ranger/issues/86#issuecomment-17346249


#### The text is too long for my terminal window and wraps to the next line causing the image to not render correctly.

There are a few ways to fix this.

* Disable line wrapping with `$line_wrap off` in the script or with the launch flag `--line_wrap off`

* The uptime and gtk info lines each have a shorthand option that makes their output smaller. You can <br \>
  enable them by changing these variables or using these flags.

```sh
# In script options
uptime_shorthand="on"
gtk_shorthand="on"
gpu_shorthand="on"

# Launch flags
--uptime_shorthand on
--gtk_shorthand on
--gpu_shorthand on
```

* Edit the info array to make the subtitles shorter

* Resizing the terminal so that the lines don't wrap.


#### The text is pushed over too far to the right

The easiest way to fix this is to change the value of `--gap` or `$gap`<br \>
to a negative value. For example `--gap -10` will move the text 10 spaces to the left.


#### getgpu doesn't show my exact video card name

If your `lspci | grep "VGA"` output looks like this:

```
01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: NVIDIA Corporation Device 1401 (rev a1)
```

Instead of this:

```
01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: NVIDIA Corporation GM206 [GeForce GTX 960] (rev a1)
```

Then you're affected by the issue.

This is caused by your `/usr/share/misc/pci.ids\*` files being outdated and you can fix it<br \>
by running this command as root.

```
sudo update-pciids
```

<!-- Todo {{{ -->


## Todo

Here's what's on my todo list

- More info outputs. Now that it's easy to customize what's printed and<br \>
  everything is a function we can add optional support for pretty much anything.

    - Resolution (Just missing Windows support)
    - ~~GTK themes~~
    - Terminal Font
        - This will be difficult to add as there's no standard way of getting this info. We can't check<br \>
        for terminal config files because the user may have multiple terminals installed.<br \>
        Using `$PPID` isn't an option because it won't work in tmux/screen, subshells or neovim terminal splits.
    - GPU (In master but experimental) See **[issue #21](https://github.com/dylanaraps/fetch/issues/21)**.
