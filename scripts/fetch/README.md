# fetch

This is the home of my fetch script! This script gathers info <br />
about your system and prints it to the terminal next to an image of your choice!

**NOTE: See this wiki page for info on the new info function and it's usage**

<!-- Features {{{ -->


## Features

- **Supports Linux, Mac OS X, BSD and Windows (Cygwin)!**
    - If the script doesn't work on your system, open an issue.
- **It's Fast**
    - The script makes heavy use of bash builtins and <br \>string manipulation.
- **Display an image next to the info.**
    - Use your current wallpaper, shuffle through a directory or just <br \>display an image of your choice.
    - Supports using w3m or iTerm2 to display the images.
- **Display ascii next to the info.**
    - Use a file containing ascii art as the image.
- **Highly Customizable**
    - You can customize almost everything.
        - See Usage below or lines 23-233 in script
- **Take a screenshot at the end.**
    - It's disabled by default and you can specify the cmd <br \>to use with `--scrotcmd cmd` at launch or by <br \>changing the value of `$scrotcmd` in the script.
- **Smart crop (or Waifu crop)**
    - See https://github.com/dylanaraps/fetch/wiki/What-is-Smart-Crop%3F

<!-- Dependences {{{ -->


## Dependencies

### Required dependencies:

**All OS:**

## Post Install


#### Sizing the image correctly

**NOTE:** For the images to be sized correctly you need to set the `$font_width` variable.
If you don't know your font width in pixels keep trying values until the image is sized correctly.

You can also use the launch flag `--font_width` to set it on the fly.


#### Customizing what info gets displayed

At the top of the script there's a function that allows you to customize all of the info that gets displayed.

Here's what you can do:

- Add new info lines
- Change the ordering of the info
- Remove unwanted info lines
- Use bash syntax to control when info gets displayed

See this wiki page that goes more in-depth about it:

https://github.com/dylanaraps/fetch/wiki/Customizing-Info


#### Customizing the script using a custom alias

If you don't want to edit the script you can customize almost everything using launch flags!

Here's what my fetch alias looks like:

```sh
alias fetch2="fetch \
--block_range 1 8 \
--line_wrap off \
--bold off \
--uptime_shorthand on \
--gtk_shorthand on \
--colors 4 1 8 8 8 7 \
"
```

<!-- Frequently Asked Questions {{{ -->


## Frequently Asked Questions


#### How do I enable screenfetch mode?

Launching the script with `--ascii distro` or setting `ascii="distro"` and `image="ascii"` <br \>
inside the script will launch the script in "screenfetch mode". The script will display your<br \>
distro's ascii next to the info, exactly like screenfetch.

![arch](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/972490362219f4aa087a0a9491df24d506590542/687474703a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f746741504a76322e706e67)


#### Why doesn't fetch support my wallpaper setter?

It's hard to add support for other wallpaper setters as<br \>
they don't provide a way of getting the current wallpaper from the cli.

If your wallpaper setter **does** provide a way of getting the current wallpaper<br \>
or you know where it's stored then adding support won't be a problem!<br \>

<!-- Issues and Workarounds {{{ -->


## Issues and Workarounds


#### fetch: line 1655: /usr/lib/w3m/w3mimgdisplay: No such file or directory


You're getting this error because the script can't find w3mimgdisplay in it's<br \>
default location. You can fix this by setting the config option `$w3m_img_path`<br \>
to the correct location of w3mimgdisplay.

Other places that `w3mimgdisplay` could located be are:

    /usr/lib/w3m/w3mimgdisplay
    /usr/libexec/w3m/w3mimgdisplay
    /usr/lib64/w3m/w3mimgdisplay
    /usr/libexec64/w3m/w3mimgdisplay


#### The image is blank and won't show up.


If the images display in `ranger` and `w3m` then it's an issue with my script and not<br \>
your terminal emulator.

Some terminal emulators don't support viewing images with w3m. You can either disable<br \>
images with `--image off` at launch or `image=off` inside the script.


#### The image is rendering with black lines in Urxvt while using an xft font.

This is an issue with w3mimgdisplay and not the script. You can find a possible workaround here:

https://github.com/hut/ranger/issues/86#issuecomment-17346249


#### The text is too long for my terminal window and wraps to the next line causing the image to not render correctly.

There are a few ways to fix this.

* Disable line wrapping with `line_wrap=off` in the script or with the launch flag `--line_wrap off`

* The uptime and gtk info lines each have a shorthand option that makes their output smaller. You can <br \>
  enable them by changing these variables or using these flags.

```sh
# In script options
uptime_shorthand="on"
gtk_shorthand="on"
gpu_shorthand="on"

# Launch flags
--uptime_shorthand on
--gtk_shorthand on
--gpu_shorthand on
```

* Edit the info array to make the subtitles shorter

* Resizing the terminal so that the lines don't wrap.


#### The text is pushed over too far to the right

The easiest way to fix this is to change the value of `--gap` or `$gap`<br \>
to a negative value. For example `--gap -10` will move the text 10 spaces to the left.


#### getgpu doesn't show my exact video card name

If your `lspci | grep "VGA"` output looks like this:

```
01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: NVIDIA Corporation Device 1401 (rev a1)
```

Instead of this:

```
01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: NVIDIA Corporation GM206 [GeForce GTX 960] (rev a1)
```

Then you're affected by the issue.

This is caused by your `/usr/share/misc/pci.ids\*` files being outdated and you can fix it<br \>
by running this command as root.

```
sudo update-pciids
```
