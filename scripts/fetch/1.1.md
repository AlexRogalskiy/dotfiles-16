# Fetch 1.1 changelog

- Fetch now has a config file that you can share with people and<br \>
keep between script versions!
- Added `--config` and `$config_file` to specify a custom config location.
- Added `$config` to enable / disable config files
- If `w3m` or `imagemagick` aren't installed we gracefully fallback to no image mode.
- Fix padding escape codes on BSD systems.
- Swap escape codes from `\e` to `\033` for consistency.
- We only move the cursor to the bottom of the terminal in w3m/iterm2 rendering modes.
- Cursor position is now dynamic based on the height of the ascii and info text.
- If images and ascii are off, don't clear the terminal
- The script now exits correctly.
