# Dylan's Dotfiles

Welcome to my dotfiles repo. Around 6 months ago I stopped using Linux on my main PC due to university requiring some Windows only programs. University is over and I can run Linux on my PC again so I've decided to redo my dotfiles from scratch.

My dotfiles are now managed with GNU stow so you can easily install and uninstall parts of it with ease. This should satisfy those who find my setup and ask for help installing it. \^\^


## Setup

- Application Launcher: `dmenu2`
- Shell: `bash`
- Terminal Emulator: `termite`
- Text Editor: `neovim`
- Web Browser: `Firefox`
- Window Manager: `i3-gaps`


## Screenshots

Coming soon :)
